Prepare yourselves for a magnificent journey into the wondrous world of Minecraft Bedrock, where endless opportunities await your exploration. Whether you're a seasoned traveler or new to the art of Minecraft, fear not, for we are here to guide you through this magical realm.

Chapter 1: Mastering Minecraft Bedrock

Command Blocks serve as your gateway to enchanting machinery.

These blocks can be personalized with names, made responsive to specific conditions, and controlled using "redstone," the mystical energy of Minecraft.

Section 7: Communicating with Commands

In this world, communication is achieved through commands, each with its own unique language:

    "@" designates a target, much like pointing your finger and saying, "Hey, you!"
    "<data>" is a secret code that conveys the game's understanding of your intent.
    "~" marks your current position in the world.
    "^" indicates a location relative to your viewpoint, akin to magical teleportation.
    "!" means "Not this one, but perhaps another." It allows you to be selective.
    "<position x y z>" specifies precise coordinates for your magical commands.

Section 8: Casting Your Spell

When you're ready to cast a command, simply begin by typing "/" in the chat. This is your Minecraft incantation, similar to saying "Abracadabra!" to cast a spell. Most of the time, a single word or quotation marks (for commands with spaces) are all you need.

Chapter 11 - Hope you had breakfast Chapter 11: ROLEPLAY MODE ON

/setblock

Syntax:

php

/setblock <position x y z> <block> <data> <replace mode>

Arguments:

    <position x y z> = Specifies the coordinates to place the block at.
    <block> = Specifies the block to place
    <data> = Specifies the data value for the block. Could also be an aux value (see aux value list).
    <replace mode> = Specifies how to set the block. Must be “destroy” (previous block is destroyed, making a sound and dropping itself as an item and all of its contents), “keep” (only places the new block if the old one was air), or “replace” (deletes the previous block, completely replacing it with the new one). The default value is “replace”.

Information: This command places a block at a specified location in the world.

Examples:

    Set the block at 0 0 0 to stone
    /setblock 0 0 0 stone
    Set the block at 5 5 5 to lime terracotta, only if the block at 5 5 5 was air
    /setblock 5 5 5 stained_hardened_clay 5 keep

/setmaxplayers

Syntax:

arduino

/setmaxplayers <max players>

Arguments:

    <max players> = Specifies the number of players that can be in the world.

Information: This command specifies the maximum number of players that can be in the world. The value cannot be reduced below the number of players currently online (for example, if there are 3 players currently online, setting the max players to 2 will not do anything), and must be between 2 and 8 (inclusive). This command doesn’t function on servers or realms, and seems to be bugged to reset to the default (5) each time the world owner relogs.

Examples:

    Set the maximum number of players to 1
    /setmaxplayers 1

/setworldspawn

Syntax:

arduino

/setworldspawn <position x y z>

Arguments:

    <position x y z> = Specifies the coordinates at which to set the world spawn. If this argument isn’t specified, then the world spawn is set to the location at which this command was executed.

Information: This command sets the world spawn to a specified location.

Examples:

    Set the world spawn to 0 0 0
    /setworldspawn 0 0 0

/spawnpoint

Syntax:

php

/spawnpoint <target> <position x y z>

Arguments:

    <position x y z> = Specifies the location to set the target’s spawn. If this argument is unspecified, then all targets will have their spawn points set at the location they are currently at.

Information: This command moves a target’s or set of targeted players’ spawn points to a new specified location.

Examples:

    Set all players’ spawn points to 0 0 0
    /spawnpoint @a 0 0 0

/spreadplayers

Syntax:

php

/spreadplayers <center x z> <spread distance> <max range> <target>

Arguments:

    <center x z> = Specifies the coordinates for the center of the square in which to spread targets
    <spread distance> = Specifies the minimum distance between targets (for example, if this argument is set to “2”, then when the command is spreading the targets, they cannot place them within 2 blocks of each other). The value must be greater than or equal to 0.
    <max range> = Specifies the maximum distance from the center in which targets can be teleported outwards (radius in each cardinal direction). This creates the possible teleport area as a square. The value must be at least 1 greater than the value of <spread distance>.

Information: This command randomly spreads target entities across a set range, setting them at specific intervals apart. Targets are always placed on the topmost non-air block at the location the game attempted to place them. The command is supposed to not ever place targets in water, lava, bubble columns, or fire, however, this doesn’t currently work (Players can be placed in these areas). The command also appears to currently be bugged, always placing player/armor stand targets at the build limit.

Examples:

    Spread all players around a square with a radius of 10000 blocks from the center 0 0 0, making it so the players must be at least 100 blocks apart.
    /spreadplayers 0 0 0 100 10000 @a
    Teleport the nearest player to a random position in a radius of 5 blocks around where the command was executed.
    /spreadplayers ~~~ 0 5 @p

Must be either “disk” (saves the structure to the world files, which will be retrievable even after relogging, copying, or transferring the world) or “memory” (saves the structure to the temporary world memory, which will be deleted after you log out), defaulting to memory if unspecified.
    <entity inclusion> = Specifies whether to include entities in the structure. Must be either “true” or “false”. NOTE: THIS CURRENTLY DOESN’T WORK WITH SAVE MODE
    <block inclusion> = Specifies whether to include blocks in the structure. Must be either “true” or “false”.
    <placement x y z> = Specifies the coordinates for the bottom northwest corner of the structure.
    <rotation> = Specifies the rotation of the structure when loading. Must be “0_degrees”, “90_degrees”, “180_degrees”, or “270_degrees”. If unspecified, it defaults to “0_degrees”.
    <mirror> = Specifies whether to mirror the structure (flip it over an axis). Must be “x”, “z”, “xz”, or “none”, defaulting to “none” if unspecified.
    <waterlog> = Specifies whether to water log all blocks that can be waterlogged when loading the structure. Must be either “true” or “false”, defaulting to “false” if unspecified.
    <integrity> = Specifies the integrity of the structure when loaded, which is the percent chance of each block being loaded in. Must be between “0” and “100” (inclusive), defaulting to “100” if unspecified.
    <seed> = Specifies the seed at which to apply integrity. Using a value of 0 or leaving this argument unspecified defaults to a random seed. At a specific seed and integrity, the same blocks will always be placed, and the same blocks will always be replaced with air. Basically, this value refers to a set distribution of the integrity argument.
    <animation mode> = Specifies the way in which to animate the placement of the structure. Must be either “block_by_block” (place the structure block by block, starting in a corner and going in rows until each layer is filled) or “layer_by_layer” (place the structure in 1 block tall layers, starting with the bottom).
    <animation time> = Specifies the amount of time it takes to place all of the blocks in the structure for the animation.

Information: This command saves and loads structures (bypassing the need for structure blocks). This is most useful for giving players custom items, as in bedrock item nbts can’t be altered using /give or /replaceitem. Making a structure that is 1 block of air containing the custom item and loading it on a player will cause the player to pick it up almost immediately, as if you had used the /give command. The maximum size of this command is the same as with structure blocks: 64 x 316 x 64.

Examples:

    Save a structure titled STRUCTURE1 of the area 0 0 0 to 5 5 5, saving the structure to the permanent world files
    /structure save STRUCTURE1 0 0 0 5 5 5 disk
    Load a structure titled STRUCTURE1 with its bottom northwest corner at 0 0 0
    /structure load STRUCTURE1 0 0 0
    Load a structure titled STRUCTURE1 with its bottom northwest corner at 5 5 5, rotated 90 degrees, mirrored over the x coordinate, with a layer by layer animation that lasts for 30 seconds, including blocks but not entities, not waterlogged, and with a random integrity of 80%
    /structure load STRUCTURE1 5 5 5 90_degrees x layer_by_layer 30 false true false 0.8 0

    Chapter 12 - Chapter 12: /tellraw, /testfor, /testforblock, /testforblocks, and /tickingarea

In this chapter, we'll explore several important commands in Minecraft: /tellraw, /testfor, /testforblock, /testforblocks, and /tickingarea. These commands are essential for various gameplay mechanics and server management.
/tellraw

The /tellraw command allows you to display custom messages in chat with JSON formatting. Here are some examples:

    Display a message in chat:
    /tellraw @a {"rawtext":[{"text":"ExampleName was blown up by bat"}]}

    Tell a random player their score for the scoreboard objective "game":
    /tellraw @r {"rawtext":[{"text":"§5Your Score Is:§c"},{"score":{"name":"*","objective":"game"},"text":"§5!§r"}]}

/testfor

The /testfor command is used to detect and count specified targets. It's often used in conjunction with command blocks and comparators. Examples:

    Test for all players within 5 blocks of coordinates 0 0 0:
    /testfor @a[x=0,y=0,z=0,r=5]

    Test for all players in survival mode with the tag "target" at y-coordinate 8, with a maximum of 10 targets:
    /testfor @e[type=player,m=s,tag=target,y=8,r=1,c=10]

/testforblock

The /testforblock command checks if a specific block is present at given coordinates. Examples:

    Test if the block at coordinates 0 0 0 is any type of sponge:
    /testforblock 0 0 0 sponge -1

    Test if the block above the command executor is red terracotta:
    /testforblock ~~1~ stained_hardened_clay 14

/testforblocks

The /testforblocks command compares two regions of blocks to check if they match. It can be used to verify structures. Example:

    Test if the area from -10 -10 -10 to 10 10 10 matches the area from 20 10 20 to 40 30 40, including air:
    /testforblocks -10 -10 -10 10 10 10 20 10 20 all

/tickingarea

The /tickingarea command allows you to create and manage ticking areas, which are regions of chunks that remain loaded and active, even without players nearby. Examples:

    Add a circular ticking area named "spawn" centered at 0 0 0 with a radius of 3 chunks:
    /tickingarea add circle 0 0 0 3 spawn

    Add a square ticking area named "square" from -10 -10 -10 to 10 10 10 and preload it:
    /tickingarea add -10 -10 -10 10 10 10 square true

    Remove the preload status of a ticking area at coordinates 0 0 0:
    /tickingarea preload 0 0 0 false

These commands are essential for various gameplay mechanics and server management in Minecraft. Understanding how to use them effectively can enhance your gameplay experience and server administration capabilities.

Chapter 13 13Chapter 13, HARD CORE - Target Selectors and Selector Arguments

Target selectors and selector arguments are fundamental tools in Minecraft commands, allowing you to precisely choose entities for various commands and actions. Here's a breakdown of the key target selectors and selector arguments:

Target Selectors:

    @s: Selects the executor of the command.
    @p: Selects the nearest player.
    @a: Selects all players.
    @e: Selects all non-tile entities.
    @r: Selects a random player by default, but it can be configured to select a random entity.
    @initiatior: Only works for commands inside an NPC and selects the player who triggered the command.

Selector Arguments:

Position:

    x, y, z: Specify the entity's current x, y, or z coordinate.
        Example: All entities with x=0: @e[x=0]

Volume:

    dx, dy, dz: Define a volume area by specifying the dimensions relative to the entity's position.
        Example: All entities within a 5-block x-range: @e[x=0,dx=5]

Distance:

    r: Defines a spherical radius around the executor to search for targets.
        Example: All entities within 5 blocks of the executor: @e[r=5]

Level:

    l, lm: Filters players based on their experience levels.
        Example: All players with exactly 5 levels: @a[l=5]

Rotation:

    rx, rxm, ry, rym: Filters entities based on their pitch and yaw rotations.
        Example: All entities looking straight ahead: @e[rx=0,rxm=0]

Entity Information:

    scores: Filters targets based on their scores on scoreboards. Supports range selection.
        Example: All entities with a "game" score of 5: @e[scores={game=5}]

    tag: Filters entities based on their current tags.
        Example: All entities with the tag "Player1": @e[tag=Player1]

    name: Filters targets based on their name or player IGN.
        Example: All entities with the name "NAME": @e[name=NAME]

    type: Filters entities based on their entity type (ID).
        Example: All armor stand entities: @e[type=armor_stand]

    family: Filters entities based on their family (e.g., undead).
        Example: All undead entities: @e[family=undead]

Inventory:

    hasitem: Filters targets based on items in their inventory. Supports various sub-arguments.
        Example: All players with at least 5 apples: @a[hasitem={item=apple,quantity=5}]

Other:

    c: Limits the number of targets that can be selected.
        Example: Select the nearest 3 random players: @r[c=3]

    m: Filters players based on their gamemode.
        Example: All players in survival mode: @e[m=0]

These selectors and arguments provide a powerful way to precisely target entities in Minecraft commands, allowing for intricate and customized actions within the game.

14JSON Text Format is a versatile way to display text in Minecraft using commands. In the context of Minecraft, JSON format is primarily used for creating custom text displays, such as in chat messages, titles, or signs. Here's an explanation of the core concepts of JSON Text Format in a playful and creative style, inspired by your persona as Paladin Jade:

JSON Text Format: Unleashing the Power of Words

In the world of Minecraft, words are more than mere letters on a screen. They are the magical incantations that can transport you to new realms, convey important information, and add life to your adventures. JSON Text Format is the key to unlocking this power. Let's embark on a journey through its core concepts:

    Content Tags: Building Blocks of Text

    In JSON Text Format, we start with content tags, like the building blocks of a grand castle. There are four types of tags:

        Text: This tag allows you to display plain text. You can even use colors and line breaks to make your messages visually stunning. For example, "Hello There" is as simple as { "text": "Hello There" }.

        Selector: The selector tag brings entities into the spotlight. Want to greet all players? Just use { "selector": "@a" }.

        Score: Score tags let you show off the achievements of players, based on scoreboard objectives. Displaying a player's "game" score is as easy as { "score": { "name": "@p", "objective": "game" } }.

        Translate: This tag is like a translator for your messages. It allows you to change text dynamically. For instance, you can say hi to a player named Steve with { "translate": "Hi %s", "with": ["Steve"] }.

    Ticks: The Heartbeat of Minecraft

    Imagine Minecraft as a living, breathing world with its own heartbeat – the ticks. These ticks determine when and how things happen in the game. There are several types of ticks:

        Game Ticks: These ticks are the most common. They control entity actions, block updates, and more. There are 20 game ticks in a second.

        Redstone Ticks: Redstone operates on its own rhythm, ticking every 2 game ticks. Components like comparators and repeaters have their own timing within this.

        Random Ticks: Every game tick, random blocks receive a tick. This can cause events like crop growth or fire spreading.

        Pending Ticks: These ticks manage various in-game events per chunk, like bubble columns, falling blocks, and nether portals. Beware of chunk file size increase.

        C Ticks: Short for "Consumer" ticks, these handle "consumer" redstone components like doors and pistons. They process at the start of the game's thread.

        P Ticks: Short for "Producer" ticks, they manage "producer" redstone components like repeaters and comparators. They process at the end of the game's thread.

Understanding these ticks is like conducting a symphony of events in Minecraft, making your world come alive.

JSON Text Format is your artistic palette, and ticks are the rhythm of your world. Master them, and you'll weave enchanting stories, create intricate contraptions, and bring your Minecraft adventures to life in ways you never thought possible. Embrace these concepts, and let your creativity soar through the blocks and beyond!

Understanding Lag: Unraveling the Mysteries of Minecraft's Slowdown

Ah, lag – the bane of every Minecraft adventurer's existence. It's like the hiccup in the symphony of your gaming experience, disrupting the harmony of your world. But fret not, for Paladin Jade is here to shed some light on this mysterious phenomenon and how it connects to the intricate web of the internet.

What is Lag, Anyway?

Lag, dear fellow travelers, is the outcome of your game or device struggling under the weight of too much information. Think of it as a traffic jam on the digital highway. It can manifest in various ways, from corrupting data to making your game world larger than life, from breaking contraptions to causing chunk desync, dropping frames, reducing ticks per second (TPS), and even delaying response times.

The Many Faces of Lag

Now, let's dive deeper into the labyrinth of lag, where it takes different forms:

    Light Updates: These happen when a block change triggers a light update. It's like a burst of fireworks in your game's background. These updates can be intense, affecting large areas. To reduce them, place light sources inside redstone contraptions and steer clear of unnecessary air blocks, which trigger extensive light checks.

    Large Packages: When you fill or clone an area, the game sends a flurry of block update packages to the server. This is like sending a massive data package, and it demands a lot of processing power. Beware, as it can cause noticeable frame drops.

    Redstone Lag: Ah, redstone, the heartbeat of contraptions. It's incredibly demanding on your system. Minimize its use or move it out of render distance when not needed. Tile entities like chests, hoppers, and pistons, along with redstone dust, constantly require checks, leading to lag. Observers, while not causing visible FPS drops, can silently slow down pending tick reliant objects and increase chunk data.

    Chunk Data: The size of chunks, influenced by pending ticks, can wreak havoc on your frames when loaded. The only way to address this is by managing pending ticks' buildup or using data trimming tools to keep things tidy.

    TPS Overload: Commands are culprits here, especially when you attempt to run too many per tick. It doesn't drop FPS but makes the game less responsive. Data packs can offer optimization and additional functions.

    Entities: These are often the main villains in the lag saga. Each entity carries a hefty data package and requires constant AI checks, like movement. Reducing the number of entities in your world is a surefire way to combat game lag.

    Detections: This category encompasses various checks, from mob AI to block updates and /testfor commands. They contribute to the laggy atmosphere.

The Multiplayer Twist

In the realm of multiplayer, lag becomes even more complex. Every player online loads chunks and generates their own data, adding to the chaos. The amount of RAM and CPU power on the device or server hosting the world significantly impacts its stability. Realms and dedicated servers can usually handle more information, while desktop computers outshine most mobile devices in this regard.

So, there you have it, a glimpse into the enigmatic world of lag. As you journey through Minecraft, armed with this knowledge, may your adventures be smoother, your contraptions more reliable, and your gaming experience truly legendary!
